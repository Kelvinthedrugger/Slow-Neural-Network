# Slow neural network

## Introduction

Implement everything with pure Python data structures

Will be migrated to compile language version so that it's faster

Doing this for practice, nothing ambitious/aggressive going on


## TODO

#### Advanced indexing (like numpy array and L() @fastcore)

#### Forward pass

#### Backprop

#### Flexible architecture (not just sequential model)
